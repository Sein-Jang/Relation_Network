# Relation Networks in Tensorflow
Tensorflow Implementation of Relation Network

## Descriptions
The purpose of this project is aimed to understand Relation Network for my personal research. First of all, I'll implement **Relation Network** proposed in the paper [A Simple Neural Network Module for Relational Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427). Next, implement **Wild Relation Network** proposed in the paper [Measuring Abstract Reasoning in Neural Networks](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/santoro18a.html).
